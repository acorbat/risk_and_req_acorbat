# Discuss Risks and Requirments alignment of two sequences

Discuss Risks and Requirments (A short Needs Analysis) for a program that implements a Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm for alignment of two sequences
- Think about what the user needs from your application
- Think about how the user interacts
- Think about what the risks are in terms of access, legality 
- Think about risks of dataloss, etc.
- Think about requirments on users system

A short cheklist of categories
-  Uncontroled System Access
-  Ineffective Security Practices
-  Data loss
-  Program Errors
   -   such as yeailding the wrong result
   -   Causing unintended system behavior

## Requirements

  - Interface
  - Usage information
  - Tutorial
  - export file with output or print to CL

  - space to upload the sequence and parameters (CLI/Webpage)
  
## Risks
  
  - Legality of using blast or any code from others (patenting or licensing)
  - OS where the algorithm is going to be used
  - How many queries can you make to the system
  
  - Are we going to keep user files in our system? or just queries?
  
### Uncontroled System Access
  
  - Many users logged in
  - Many sequences or too long sequences to align
  - Where are we storing the sequences? How do we separate different user data?
  
### Ineffective Security Practices
### Data loss
### Program Errors

  
 # Feedback
  
  - Scoping a project is important. If we overscope aiming for a huge project, then we cannot finish it.
